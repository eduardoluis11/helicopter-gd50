## Notes

### Bing AI's Chat disclaimer
I, Eduardo Salinas, generated the references for this homework assignment in APA format in the "References" section of this README file using Bing AI's chat from bing.com. Upon generating draft language, I reviewed, edited, and revised the language to my own liking, and I take ultimate responsibility for the content of this text. I did not use an app to generate this citation other than Bing's AI web app. I copied the text from Bing's chat, pasted it on a text editor, and then edited it.

### Sources used from Bing's chat from bing.com

I attached a file called bing-chat-3-26-24.txt, which contains the chat with Bing's AI from bing.com from which I learned how to attach a script to a Prefab. It's included on my references on a section below on this README file. If you want to see the whole message generated by Bing's AI, please, check the bing-chat-3-26-24.txt file.

### Use of GitHub Copilot

I'm paying for GitHub Copilot's Individual Subscription, which generated some of my code. I will add all the instructions that I gave to Copilot that generated my code in the "References" section of this README file.

### Code generated by GitHub Copilot

I saved all the code generated by the Copilot Chat that I used in my project in a file called "copilot-chat.txt". All the Copilot code that I used that's being cited on my references can be found in that .txt file.
